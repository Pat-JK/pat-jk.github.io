So, it's been a week since installing OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and using it on a daily basis. What do I think? I love it.

It's a nice change of pace coming from Arch. I do use the terminal for many things still, but YaST makes a lot of tinkering easier. The few pieces of software I couldn't get from the repos I was able to get from Flatpak, which was preinstalled. 

Don't really have much to say other than I feel it's a great alternative to Arch and other rolling release distros. It's stable and runs well, and I haven't found a program that's given me trouble. It's only been a week, so that can easily change. I may make more posts later on if I run into issues or find something neat.
