As cool as junk.cam was, I decided to part with it. I mean, at the current moment I still own it but I'm not renewing it and it's up for sale. Wanted a more personal domain and found a decent deal on the new one, [pats.quest](https://pats.quest). junk.cam will redirect here until expired/sold.

Why pats.quest? Why not? I'm a dweeb who likes vidya and this is my personal quebsite (quest/website) 😝
