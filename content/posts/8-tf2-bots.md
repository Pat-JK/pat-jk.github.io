Been getting into TF2 again this year. Love the game, it's one of my most played games ever. Started playing in 2007 on the 360, then in 2008 got a laptop decent enough to run some games and bought TF2 on Steam. Even bought it on PS3 just to own it on there, despite being the worst version.

Anyway, as someone who has been playing off and on for well over a decade, the current state of the game pisses me off.

I get it, it's an old game, the new content is all community made, Valve is pretty hands off except for bundling up some community made stuff a couple times a year at most.

But come on, these bots are ruining the game and are out of control. There needs to be at least a couple people at Valve who care enough to do something. I'm not super up to date on Valve stuff, but I do know that with CSGO/CS2, they've been working on a neural net based anticheat called VACNet. I've heard it's really good. Would it kill them to get a few people working on implimenting it to TF2? They still make loads of money off the game, so they could at least put a few hours of work in before going back to the community making all the new content.

It's just sad. I haven't played TF2 the past few years too much, but this year I've been getting into it a lot again and it's depressing that every match has become a battle between trying to kick every bot that joins or giving up and requeing, hoping that you get lucky. That's insane, having to get lucky to not have a bot match. I know there are tools such as [TF2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/surepy/tf2_bot_detector), or as I'm trying lately, Linux/Win multiplatform tool [TF2 Bot Kicker](https://github.com/Bash-09/tf2-bot-kicker-gui), we shouldn't need external programs to manage the problem. At the very least, these tools should be integrated into the game.

I'm just depressed. I love Team Fortress 2, and the state it's in is a shadow of its former self, despite it having the ability to be so much more.
