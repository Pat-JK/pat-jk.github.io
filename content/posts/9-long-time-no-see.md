Been awhile since I've updated this site. Not too much going on but here's a little update on what I've been up to.

While, Tumbleweed was nice, I ended up switching over to EndeavourOS. Without getting into specifics, it's just easier for me to do what I want using an Arch based distro. I did enjoy my experiment with OpenSUSE, but I prefer the minimal base system given with Arch and its forks and the vast amount of packages in the AUR. While everything I wanted to use could be used in flatpak form or manually installed, it's easier to configure some things as system services when they're in the proper repos and get installed system wide without a container.

I've also grown my media library to a size where having some helper tools to manage it is very welcome, and as such I spent some time setting up quite a few *arr services for managing my library and it's been great. It's transformed how I manage my media and I don't think I could go back to doing everything manually.

Another thing I've done, that has no real relevance to anybody, is that I've switched from bash to zsh. I tried fish for a brief period, but ended up settling on zsh. I enjoy the customization and the fact that it's still POSIX compliant. I did try using Oh-My-ZSH coming from Oh-My-Bash, but ended up switching over to [Zim](https://zimfw.sh). It has all the features I want with the added bonus of being much more lightweight.

So yeah, I haven't been up to much, just a lot of tinkering around and enhancing my home services productivity. Next step is to maybe actually get into programming... We'll see...
